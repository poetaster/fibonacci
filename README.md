a rpn calculator with an exprtk evaluation pane. sympy &amp; exprtk in one SFOS app

This is in part a fork of https://github.com/lainwir3d/sailfish-rpn-calculator which was too difficult to build and needed to see some attention paid to library updates, etc.

I've extended it with an interface to exprtk for programmable calculations. Eventually, I'll expose the sympy interfaces in a similar fashion.

It may all be merged back into @lainvir3d's project if he is so inclined.
