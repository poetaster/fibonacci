*1.0.2*
- use pytest for testing
- Bug fix for windows compatibility

*1.0.1*
- better error checking so fastcache now plays well with signals.  There is a performance hit for this.  Next Release should handle this better.

*1.0.0*

- clru_cache now supports dynamic attributes.
- (c)lru_cache is now threadsafe via custom reentrant locks.

*0.4.3*

- Fixed bug in hash computations which resulted in `stack overflow`.  The appropriate error (RuntimeError) is now returned

*0.4.2*

- The 'state' argument to clru_cache can now be a list or a dict
- Slight performance improvemants
- Fixed compiler warnings for Python 2 builds
- Use setuptools by default.  The environment variable USE_DISTUTILS=True
  forces the use of distutils

*0.4.0*

API change:

Default behavior of fastcache is changed to raise TypeError on
unhashable arguments to be 100% consistent with stdlib.

Introduce a new argument 'unhashable' which controls how fastcache
responds to unhashable arguments:
	*'error' (default) - raise TypeError
	*'warning' - raise UserWarning and call decorated function with args
	*'ignore'  - call decorated function
